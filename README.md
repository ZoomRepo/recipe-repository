# Recipe Repository

This repository now includes two major components:

1. A configurable recipe scraper capable of harvesting recipes from the
   approved domains defined in `config/scraper_templates.json`. The scraper
   normalises the extracted data and persists it into the provided MySQL
   database.
2. A Flask web application that reads the persisted recipes, allows you to
   search across titles, descriptions, ingredients, and instructions, and view
   complete recipe pages.

## Prerequisites

Install the Python dependencies (re-run this whenever `requirements.txt`
changes to refresh the virtual environment):

```bash
make setup
```

## Running the scraper

The scraper exposes a command line interface:

```bash
python -m scraper.cli --config config/scraper_templates.json
```

### Configuring scraper templates

Scraper behaviour is defined through the JSON templates stored in
`config/scraper_templates.json`. The file contains a list of template objects,
one per supported site. Each template controls how recipes are discovered and
extracted:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Example Site",
    "url": "https://www.example.com",
    "type": "cooking",
    "recipes": {
      "listing": [
        {
          "url": "https://www.example.com/recipes",
          "link_selector": "article h2 a",
          "pagination_selector": ".pagination a.next"
        }
      ]
    },
    "article": {
      "title": ["h1.entry-title"],
      "description": [".recipe-summary"],
      "ingredients": [".ingredients li"],
      "instructions": [".instructions li"],
      "image": ["meta[property='og:image']::attr(content)"]
    },
    "structured_data": {
      "enabled": true,
      "json_ld_selector": "script[type='application/ld+json']",
      "json_ld_path": "@graph[?(@['@type']=='Recipe')]"
    }
  }
]
```

Key fields:

* `name` and `url` identify the source website. `type` is optional metadata.
* `recipes.listing` describes how to discover article URLs. Each entry supplies
  a `url` to crawl, a CSS `link_selector` for recipe links, and an optional
  `pagination_selector` used to follow next-page links.
* `article` maps recipe fields (title, ingredients, etc.) to CSS selectors that
  should be evaluated against the article HTML.
* `structured_data` enables JSON-LD extraction when available. Set `enabled` to
  `true` and provide the selector and JSON path used to locate the recipe node.

By default it will connect to the production database at `217.43.43.202`
using the credentials provided by the user. You can override the connection or
limit the run to specific sites:

```bash
python -m scraper.cli \
    --db-host 127.0.0.1 \
    --db-user [USER] \
    --db-password [PASS] \
    --db-name reciperepository \
    --sites "BBC Good Food" "simplyrecipes.com"
```

Use `--max-pages` to constrain how many listing pages are crawled per site.

Logs are emitted to stdout and can be controlled with `--log-level` (e.g.
`--log-level DEBUG`).

If a site's configured listing pages fail or return no results the scraper now
falls back to crawling the domain's XML sitemaps (including WordPress specific
maps). This greatly improves coverage for JavaScript-driven or paginated
catalogues at the cost of additional HTTP requests. The fallback respects the
`--max-pages` option for HTML listings and caps sitemap discovery to protect the
target sites.

## Running the web application

The web application is backed by the same MySQL database. Environment
variables can be used to override the defaults shown below.

```bash
export DB_HOST=[EXTERNAL_IP]
export DB_USER=[USER]
export DB_PASSWORD=[PASS]
export DB_NAME=reciperepository

python -m webapp
```

The server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` by default. Adjust the `PORT`
environment variable if you need to use a different port.

For a production-style deployment, use the `run_app_production` make target
which launches the app with the Waitress WSGI server:

```bash
make run_app_production
```

Waitress will honour the `PORT` environment variable (defaulting to `8000`)
while loading the configuration from the same environment variables listed
above. This avoids Flask's development server warning and provides a WSGI
server suitable for running behind a reverse proxy.

### Configuring the invite-only access gate

The welcome screen keeps the site closed while it is in private testing. It
offers two flows:

* Collecting prospective users' email addresses and storing them in the
  `subscribers` table.
* Allowing invited testers to request a 6-digit code that unlocks the app on
  their device.

Only email addresses that already exist in the `invited_users` table are allowed
to request a verification message. When an address that is not listed attempts
to request a code the UI will display `Sorry but you're email is not on the
invite list.` and no message is sent.

Populate the table with the email addresses of the people you want to invite.
The service normalises emails to lower-case before the lookup so you can insert
records with any casing and they will still match.

```sql
INSERT INTO invited_users (email) VALUES
  ('qa.tester@example.com'),
  ('chef.beta@example.com');
```

Once a tester successfully enters the emailed code their device identifier is
stored in the same table. Subsequent visits from that device bypass the welcome
screen entirely.

Email delivery uses SMTP credentials when the following environment variables
are present. When they are omitted the application falls back to logging the
message contents instead of sending them.

```bash
export EMAIL_HOST=smtp.yourprovider.com
export EMAIL_PORT=587
export EMAIL_USERNAME=apikey_or_username
export EMAIL_PASSWORD=secret_password
export EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=Recipe Library <no-reply@yourdomain.com>
export EMAIL_USE_TLS=true
```

The welcome page requires Flask's session support to track the pending email
address while the user enters their verification code. Set `SECRET_KEY` in the
environment to a strong random value before deploying the app.
